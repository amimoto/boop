Boop!
===============

Boop is a little event library

It's not intended to be high-speed or amazing, just 'good enough' to get some stuff like tests and other little personal projects done. 

In other words, it's a toy library.

It is, however, designed to be fairly spartan in external library requirements and should generally work with the standard library that comes with Python.
